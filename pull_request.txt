# Add H2 Database and Liquibase Support

## Description
This PR implements the requirements from issue #1 to add H2 in-memory database and Liquibase support to the Coffee Shop API. These additions will enable better data management and local testing capabilities.

## Changes Made
- Added H2 database dependency for local development and testing
- Added Micronaut Data JPA for database access
- Configured Liquibase for database schema management
- Created initial database schema with tables for:
  - Products (coffee, food items)
  - Orders
  - Order Items
- Added H2 console configuration for easy database inspection during development
- Updated application properties with database configuration
- Added devfile for consistent development environment

## How to Test
1. Run the application using `./mvnw mn:run`
2. Access the H2 console at http://localhost:8080/h2-console
   - JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:coffeedb
   - Username: sa
   - Password: (leave empty)
3. Verify that the database tables have been created according to the Liquibase changelog

## Additional Notes
- The H2 database is configured as in-memory, so data will be lost when the application restarts
- Liquibase is set up to manage schema changes, making it easy to evolve the database structure
- The initial schema includes basic tables needed for a coffee shop application
