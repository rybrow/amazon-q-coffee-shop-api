# Add H2 In Memory Database and Liquibase Support

## Description
This PR implements the requirements from issue #1 to add H2 in-memory database and Liquibase support to the Coffee Shop API. These additions will enable better data management and local testing capabilities.

## Changes Made
- Added H2 database dependency for local development and testing
- Integrated Liquibase for database schema version control and management
- Created database schema with tables for Coffee, Orders, and OrderItems
- Added entity models with proper JPA annotations
- Implemented repository interfaces using Micronaut Data
- Created REST controllers for Coffee and Order management
- Added sample data for coffee products
- Implemented unit tests for API endpoints
- Added devfile for consistent development environment

## How to Test
1. Run the application using `./mvnw mn:run`
2. Access the H2 console at http://localhost:8080/h2-console (JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:coffeedb)
3. Test the API endpoints:
   - GET /api/coffees - List all coffees
   - GET /api/coffees/{id} - Get a specific coffee
   - POST /api/coffees - Create a new coffee
   - GET /api/orders - List all orders
   - POST /api/orders - Create a new order

## Additional Notes
- The H2 database is configured to run in-memory with sample data loaded via Liquibase
- Database schema changes are managed through Liquibase changelog files
- The application uses JPA with Hibernate as the implementation
